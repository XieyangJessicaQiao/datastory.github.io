<h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
</center>
<p>
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user-to-user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. The price of Bitcoin is measured against the fiat currency, in this case, the U.S. dollars.</p>

  <h3>How is Bitcoin price determined?</h3>
</center>
<p>The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand in the market. Specifically, the demand from buyers and the supply of sellers (miners) eventually control the price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Dennis H. Chookaszian, former chairman and CEO of CNA Insurance Companies, said the value of cryptocurrency is made up of supply and demand, but the supply and demand is driven by the discounted expected utility value and the current utility value.</p>
<p>“The current utility value means the value that cryptocurrency can be used for, such as buying goods and services,” Chookaszian said. “The cryptocurrency might not have much value now, but people expect it to replace credit card. Therefore, its utility value in the future will be very high, and that value is stated as the present discounted value of future utility.”</p>

<h3>What are the major changes of Bitcoin price since 2009?</h3>
</center>
<p>“Bitcoin was created in 2009. Because Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and there is nothing behind it, it is essentially a trading asset,” Chookaszian said. “Its value is determined by the amount people are willing to paying for it.” </p>
<p>When Bitcoin was first created, there were not many demands for it, and the value was a few cents. In 2013, the price started to rise. In about a year, it went from one dollar to 1,000 dollar, before crashing down again and fell through to 2015. Throughout 2016 and 2017, the price of Bitcoin continued to reach new highs. In December 2017, Bitcoin price skyrocketed, before dropping sharply and bouncing back again to hit another all-time high. Unfortunately, the price crashed again in February 2018. From there, the price dropped and then it went up to about 10,000. Then the price dropped towards now, which is 4,000. </p>

<h3>How is the performance of Bitcoin in 2018?</h3>
</center>
<p>“In 2018, the price of Bitcoin went from around 20,000 dollar to 4,000 dollar,” Chookaszian said. “The price dropped drastically. The market performed terribly.”</p>

<center>
<h3>What will be the future of cryptocurrency?</h3>
</center>
<p>Bitcoin is based on the blockchain technology, which will be very valuable and replace many current systems. Blockchain is just one form of the distributed ledger technology, which will continue to be used.</p>
<p>“A very small number of cryptocurrency will be used for funding, payment and similar things in the future. Bitcoin right now represents half of the cryptocurrency market. In the future, it will continue to be one of the major elements of the underlying payment system,” Chookaszian said. “ I believe the future for Bitcoin is good, however, the questions is about its price. The price will no longer be 4,000, and there is no need for 4,000.”</p>
